Our manual assessment consider all QuickSort patches are correct. 

The ground truth patch change: " else if (x > pivot) {​ " to " else if (x >= pivot) {​ "
which equals to else or else if(true). ​

Thus we consider all program repair patches semantically equivalent to else / else if(true) /else if (x >= pivot)
are correct.
